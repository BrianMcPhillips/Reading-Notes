Teams that are carefully engineered ended up being a nightmare because everyone was trying so hard to prove themselves to the group even though they would act friendly and have great interactions outside of the group. Google had a large test sample and found no correlation between good groups and bad groups from personality data or skill level. Google later came to find out that the best teams were teams that respected conversational order and did not encourage arguments between team members. People who spoke proportionately during the conversation and did not try to out shine one another made up the best teams. If one person disproportionately spoke all the time the group collective intelligence declined. Good teams also had high social sensitivity and were self aware of how they may come off to others in the group with their tone of voice. People who are sensitive to one anothers mood's and take people's feelings or personal situations into consideration make the best teams to work on. Enabling a safe space for interpersonal risk taking makes the best team.
