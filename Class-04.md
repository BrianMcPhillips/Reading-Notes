Html Chapter 4 - "Links"
    -Links are created using the <a> element.
    -The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. If yuou are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
    -You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
    -You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
    -Linking to other sites, Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
    -Linking to other pages on the same site, when you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL. If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.
    -Directory structure, On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes reffered to as directories.
    -Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
    -Email links, to create a link that starts up the user's emailprogram and addresses an email to a specified street address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto" and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
    -Opening links in a new window, if you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
CSS Chapter 15 - "Layout"
    -<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
    -Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
    -The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
    -Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
    -Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
    -Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 
    -CSS Framworks provide rules for common tasks.
    -You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
    -Building blocks, CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
    -Containing elements, if one block-level element sits inside another block-level elementthen the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
    -CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to controll the layout of a page: normal flow, relative postioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float element using the float property.
    -Normal flow, in normal flow each block level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow.
    -Relative positioning, moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
    -Absoute positioning, when the position property is given a value of absolute the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the postition of other elements on the page.
    -Fixed positioning, is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
    -Screen sizes, different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
    -Screen resolution, refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. SOme devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
    -Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
JavaScript Chapter 3 - "Functions, Methods, and Objects"
    -Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
    -Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code.
    -Furthermore, the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the teps needed to achieve a task. The script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required.
    -Declaring a function, to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statemetns needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration. 
    -Calling a function, having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
    -Declaring functions that need information, sometimes a function needs pecific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give its parameters. Inside the function the parameters act like variables.
    -Calling functions that need information, when you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in parenthesis that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or as variables.
    -Getting a single value out of a function, some functions return information to the code that called them. For example when they perform a calculation they return the result. 
    -Getting multiple values out of a function, functions can return more than one value using an array.
"6 Reasons for Pair programming"
    -Pair programming allows for iterative loops, code reviews, fast feedback, error checking and linting. These are software practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you could get all of this instantaneously? You can with pair programming, a techinique common to many agile work environments.
    -Should function more as "two heads are better than one" rather than "stop looking over my shoulder"
    -Usually has a driver and a navigator, the driver is the programmer and is the only one with hands on the keyboard. The navigator uses their words to guide the driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The navigator might also utlize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation.
    -Why pair program? -greater efficiency - engaged collaboration - learning from fellow students -Social skills - Job interview readiness - work environment readiness.
    -When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. 
    -Everyone has a different approach to problem solving, working with a teamate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 
    -Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.
